# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

[Quick Start Guide](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#quick-start)

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

### Deploy and verify the contract

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network rinkeby
```
